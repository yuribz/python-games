# Python Games

A repository with some Pygame projects created either as a personal endeavor, or while teaching coding to K-12 students. 

Not all of these games are finished. The current confirmed finished games are:
- Minesweeper

To run a game, download the directory containing the game and run the main file from that directory. Do not run games from the root directory of the repo, or they will not work.
