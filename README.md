# Python Games

A repository with some Pygame projects created either as a personal endeavor, or while teaching coding to K-12 students. 

Not all of these games are finished. The current confirmed finished games are:
- Minesweeper
- Snake (can be played and has lose condition for walls, but not bumping into itself)
- Flappy (no score counter yet)

To run a game, download the directory containing the game and run the main file from that directory. Do not run games from the root directory of the repo as they might not work and not find dependencies (if any).
